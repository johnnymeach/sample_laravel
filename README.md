# sample_laravel

This is the sample Laravel application for read/write data using MySQL.

I also included the user authentication for reading/writing the post.
If the user did not log in yet, it will redirect to the login page.

If you want to create new user, just click on the "Register button".

There is a database file "meach.sql" for this application with the existing user:
	- email: meach.sokly@gmail.com
	- password: sokly123
